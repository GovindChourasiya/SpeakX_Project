gRPC Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) in a service-oriented architecture. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework that facilitates communication between client and server applications using Protocol Buffers (protobufs) for efficient serialization and deserialization of messages. It supports multiple languages, making it ideal for building polyglot microservices.

Key Features:
Efficient communication using Protocol Buffers.
Support for various types of streaming (unary, server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional streaming).
Secure communication via TLS/SSL.
Scalability for distributed systems.
Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

Node.js (LTS version or above)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Protocol Buffers Compiler (protoc)
Install protoc by following the official guide here.
Dependencies
Navigate to the project root directory and install the required dependencies:
-npm install

Project Structure
The project is organized into two main components:

Backend: Contains the gRPC server implementation.
Frontend: Contains the gRPC client implementation.
Key Directories and Files:
proto/: Holds the .proto files defining service interfaces and message types.
backend/: Contains the gRPC server code and related configurations.
frontend/: Contains the gRPC client code for invoking server methods.
Usage
Starting the gRPC Server
Navigate to the backend directory:
-cd backend
-npm start
The server will start and listen on the configured port (default: 50051).

Running the gRPC Client
Open a new terminal window.

Navigate to the frontend directory:
-cd frontend
-npm start
The client will communicate with the server, invoking defined methods and displaying responses.

Protocol Buffer (.proto) Files
The .proto files define the structure of the messages and services used in the project. They are located in the proto/ directory and include:

Service definitions with RPC methods.
Message structures for requests and responses.
Features
Unary RPC: Simple request-response communication.
Server Streaming RPC: Server streams a sequence of responses for a single client request.
Client Streaming RPC: Client streams a sequence of requests to the server.
Bidirectional Streaming RPC: Both client and server exchange a stream of messages.
Security
The project includes optional support for TLS/SSL encryption. Configure the server with the required certificates for secure communication.

Testing
Unit and integration tests can be added to ensure functionality. You can use testing frameworks like Mocha or Jest for this.
